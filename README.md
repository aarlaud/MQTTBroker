MQTT Broker I use for MQTT communication between the Connected Hive Gateways and the rest of the ecosystem of Dashboards, apps, etc...
Currently using Mosca (mosca.io) MQTT Broker with MongoDB persistence.


Requires MongoDB installed
Refer to mongo DB install and create collection mqttcollection or change server.js persistence collection name.
